= Getting Started With Spring REST Docs

This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

.http-request
include::build/generated-snippets/news/http-request.adoc[]

.curl-request
include::build/generated-snippets/news/curl-request.adoc[]

.http-response
include::build/generated-snippets/news/http-response.adoc[]

.request-fields
include::build/generated-snippets/news/request-parameters.adoc[]

.response-fields
include::build/generated-snippets/news/response-fields.adoc[]


As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
